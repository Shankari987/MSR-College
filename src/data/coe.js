    desc: "Sri Shanmugha College of Engineering and Technology has been conferred autonomous status by the University Grants Commission, New Delhi, starting from the academic year 2023-2024. The autonomy has been granted for a period of 10 years. The institute remains affiliated with Anna University, Chennai. The Exam Cell and the Office of the Controller of Examinations operate as a unified setup. This office is responsible for various activities, some of which are unique to autonomous institutes, while others are common to both autonomous and affiliated systems. The Controller of Examinations office plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the autonomy. Its responsibilities include announcing the academic schedule, preparing question papers, conducting examinations, evaluating answer scripts, declaring results, and issuing grade sheets. Each academic year, students undertake end-semester examinations in November/December and April/May. Additionally, the Controller of Examinations ensures the proper functioning of continuous assessment tests.",
